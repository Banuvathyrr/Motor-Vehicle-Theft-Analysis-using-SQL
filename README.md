In this project, I worked on a dataset containing information about stolen vehicles, vehicle makes, and geographical locations. I conducted a comprehensive analysis to uncover insights and trends in vehicle thefts across different regions using SQL functions.

**SQL functions used:**  
‚Ä¢	SELECT  
‚Ä¢	UPDATE  
‚Ä¢	DELETE  
‚Ä¢	GROUP BY  
‚Ä¢	ORDER BY  
‚Ä¢	Aggregates (COUNT(), SUM(), AVG())  
‚Ä¢	Window functions (RANK(), ROW_NUMBER())  
‚Ä¢	CTE  
‚Ä¢	Joins  
‚Ä¢	LEAD()  
‚Ä¢	COALESCE()  
‚Ä¢	ROW_NUMBER()  

**üîç Key Insights:**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Hotspots of Vehicle Theft: Identified Auckland, New Zealand, as the region with the highest number of stolen vehicles. It's crucial to address security measures in this area to combat theft effectively.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Impact of Population Density: Discovered a correlation between population density and the frequency of vehicle thefts. Regions with higher population densities experienced more thefts, indicating a need for heightened security measures in urban areas.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Vehicle Age and Theft Susceptibility: Found that older vehicles, manufactured before 2010, were more susceptible to theft compared to newer models. This highlights the importance of upgrading security features in older vehicles to deter theft.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Day of the Week Trends: Noticed a pattern in theft occurrences based on the day of the week. Mondays and Tuesdays saw the highest number of thefts, while Saturdays and Sundays had the lowest.
